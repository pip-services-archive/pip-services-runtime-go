# Pip.Services Microservice Runtime Framework for Go

Runtime framework provides primitives to develop microservices for Pip.Service library

The framework contains the following abstracts:

* Microservice components, life cycle management and composition
* Configurations (direct, file, consul, etcd, service, ...)
* Logging and performance counters (null, log, service...)
* Business logic controller
* Data Access (memory, file, mondodb, ...)
* External dependencies
* Caching (null, memory, memcached, service, ...)
* Interceptors
* Addons
* Runners/wrappers (process, seneca, lambda, ...)
